                            Mario and Adrian, lifelong friends with a shared love for culinary arts, founded Little Lemon with a simple mission: to bring fresh, vibrant Mediterranean flavors to their community. With roots deeply embedded in Italian and Greek traditions, they wanted to create a space where every dish tells a story of their heritage, combined with modern twists that excite the palate.
